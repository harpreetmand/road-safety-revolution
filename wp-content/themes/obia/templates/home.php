        <h3>COLLISIONS</h3>
        <p>
          Collisions in bike lanes are far too common.
          Motorists often drive in, park in and swerve into bike
          lanes that aren’t properly marked or separated from
          vehicular traffic. Governments are taking too long to
          address road safety issues, so it’s up to us to be safer.

        <p>
          Potholes, both in and out of bike lanes, are a big

          motorists, which can result in serious injuries to cyclists
          and pedestrians. Governments are taking too long to
          address road safety issues, so it’s up to us to be safer.

        <p>
          Toronto’s poor road construction practices have lead
          to unsafe conditions for cyclists. Road work and
          building construction that blocks traffic lanes has
          made cycling in Toronto hazardous. Governments are
